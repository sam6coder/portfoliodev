## MY PORTFOLIO

My portfolio showcases a dynamic web and mobile application built using Flutter for the frontend and Django for the backend. The project demonstrates my ability to create seamless, user-friendly interfaces with Flutter while leveraging Djangoâ€™s robust backend capabilities for efficient data management and authentication. The mobile app provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, while the web application is fully responsive, ensuring accessibility across devices. With secure user authentication, database integration, and a clean, modern design, this portfolio reflects my expertise in creating scalable, high-performance applications that meet both user needs and business requirements.
It enlists about my education matter, working experience, projects , skills and contact information.
